Minimal AMD loader mostly stolen from [@wycats](https://github.com/wycats).

## Tests

To run the test you'll need to have
[testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) installed. Install it with `npm
install -g testem`.

_(You'll also have to install the bower components, which you can do by running
`bower install`)_

You may run them with:
```bash
testem ci
```

You can also launch testem development mode with:
```bash

```
